# key remaps
# custom mods located at /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom_remap

# what these remaps do:
#   set caps as ctrl
#   set shift+space as tab
#   set shift+backspace as del
setxkbmap -option "ctrl:nocaps, symbols:custom_remap(custom_mods)"

# tap/hold mods
#   ctrl behaves as esc when tapped
#   shift behaves as caps when tapped
